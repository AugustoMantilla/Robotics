# Forward Kinematics

## Introduction
Robotics kinematics studies robot motion without considering the forces involved, focusing on the position and orientation of its links. Forward kinematics computes the end-effector position and orientation from the joint variables. The robot is modeled as a kinematic chain of links and joints, using reference frames to describe spatial relationships. The Denavit–Hartenberg convention standardizes this representation using four parameters, simplifying the kinematic analysis of robotic manipulators.
